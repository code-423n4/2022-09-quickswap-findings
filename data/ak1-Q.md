1. Implement the `NoDelegateCall.sol` like how the uniswap is using. I am not sure the reason for this. But , I believe it could be better to stick with uniswap method. Since the time is too short, I am not able to invest time on this.

2. Add relevant error message to understand the code execution better. this could make the code handling easier.
