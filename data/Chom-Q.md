```
    (amount0, amount1) = zeroToOne == cache.exactInput // the amount to provide could be less then initially specified (e.g. reached limit)
      ? (cache.amountRequiredInitial - amountRequired, cache.amountCalculated) // the amount to get could be less then initially specified (e.g. reached limit)
```

then should be than

```
    (amount0, amount1) = zeroToOne == cache.exactInput // the amount to provide could be less than initially specified (e.g. reached limit)
      ? (cache.amountRequiredInitial - amountRequired, cache.amountCalculated) // the amount to get could be less than initially specified (e.g. reached limit)
```
